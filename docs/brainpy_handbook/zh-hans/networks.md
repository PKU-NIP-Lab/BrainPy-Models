## 3. 网络模型

With the neuron and synapse models we have realized with BrainPy, users can now build networks of there own. In this section, we will introduce two main types of network models as examples: 1) spiking neural networks that model and compute each neuron or synapse separately; 2) firing rate networks that simplify neuron groups in the network as firing rate units and compute each neuron group as one unit.

到此，读者已经了解了几种最常见、最经典的神经元和突触模型，是时候更进一步了。
