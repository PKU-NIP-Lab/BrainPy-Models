## 2. Synapse models

When we model the firing of neurons, we need to connect them. Synapse is very important for the communication between neurons, and it is an essential component of the formation of the network. Therefore, we need to model the synapse.

We will first introduce how to implement synaptic dynamics with BrainPy, then introduce synapse plasticity.
