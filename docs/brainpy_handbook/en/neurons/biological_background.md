## 1.1 Biological backgrounds

As the basic unit of neural systems, neurons maintain mystique to researchers for a long while. In recent centuries, however, along with the development of experimental techniques, researchers have painted a general figure of those little creatures working ceaselessly in our brain.

As researchers usually do in computational neuroscience, we may start with a diagram of real neuron membrane.

[dont really know what figure to put here]

The figure above is a general diagram of neuron membrane with phospholipid bilayer and ion channels. The membrane divides the ions and fluid into intracellular and extracellular, partially prevent them from exchanging. 

An ion in the fluid is subjected to two forces. The force of diffusion is caused by the ion concentration difference across the membrane, while the force of electric field is caused by the electric potential difference. When these two forces are in balance, the neuron is in a so-called resting state, and holds a membrane potential lower than 0.
