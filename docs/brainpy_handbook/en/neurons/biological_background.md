## 1.1 Biological backgrounds

As the basic unit of neural systems, neurons maintain mystique to researchers for a long while. In recent centuries, however, along with the development of experimental techniques, researchers have painted a general figure of those little creatures working ceaselessly in our brain.

As researchers usually do in computational neuroscience, we may start with a diagram of real neuron membrane.

The figure above is a general diagram of neuron membrane with phospholipid bilayer and ion channels. The membrane divides the ions and fluid into intracellular and extracellular, partially prevent them from exchanging. 

An ion in the fluid is subjected to two forces. The force of diffusion is caused by the ion concentration difference across the membrane, while the force of electric field is caused by the electric potential difference. When these two forces are in balance, the neuron  holds a membrane potential lower than 0.

There comes the concept of resting potential, and the neuron is, in a so-called resting state. If no external input is given to the neuron, it will just come to the balanced resting state, and rest.

However, the neural system receives countless inputs every millisecond, from specific stimulus inputs to non-specific background inputs. Receiving these inputs, neurons generate action potentials (or spikes) to transfer and process information all across the neural system.

Through the ion channels shown in neuron membrane diagram, the ions can exchange between the two sides of the hydrophobic phospholipid bilayer. Because of the external inputs, ion channels will switch between their open/close states, therefore allow/prohibit the exchanges of ions. During the switch, the concentrations of ions (mainly Na+ and K+) change, induce a significant change on neuron's membrane potential. A neuron's membrane potential will raise to a peak value and then fall back in a short time period. Biologically we call this series of potential changes an action potential, or a spike.
