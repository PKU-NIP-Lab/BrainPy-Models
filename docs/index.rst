BrainModels documentation
=========================

``BrainModels`` provides `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_
implementations of standard and canonical brain models (including various
neurons, synapses, networks, and intuitive paper examples).
Moreover, we welcome your model implementations, and publish them
through our `GitHub <https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainModels>`_ homepage.
In such a way, once your new model is created, it can be easily shared
with other BrainPy users.
