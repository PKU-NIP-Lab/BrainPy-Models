   contain the root `toctree` directive.

BrainPy-Models documentation
===============================

``BrainPy-Models`` is based on `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ neuronal dynamics simulation framework. Here you can find neurons, synapses models and topological networks implemented with BrainPy.

The prior goal of ``BrainPy-Models`` is to free users from repeatly implementing the most simple and commonly used models, instead they can import ``get_*()`` functions and take the advantage of our models.

.. note::

   We welcome your implementation about `neurons`, `synapses`, `learning rules`,
   `networks` and `paper examples`. https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainPy-Models
