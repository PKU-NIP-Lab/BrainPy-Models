BrainModels documentation
=========================

``BrainModels`` provides standard and canonical brain models (including
various neurons, synapses, networks, and intuitive paper examples) which
are implemented with `BrainPy <https://brainpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ simulator.
Moreover, we welcome your brain model implementations, and publish them
through our `GitHub <https://github.com/PKU-NIP-Lab/BrainModels>`_ homepage.
In such a way, once your new model is implemented, it can be easily shared
with other BrainPy users.
